Subclass/&PurpleDragonKnightFighterSubclassTitle Purple Dragon Knight
Subclass/&PurpleDragonKnightFighterSubclassDescription A Purple Dragon is a knight who inspires greatness in others by committing brave deeds in battle. The mere presence of one in a hamlet is enough to cause some orcs and bandits to seek easier prey. A lone knight is a skilled warrior, but a Purple Dragon leading a band of allies can transform even the most poorly equipped militia into a ferocious war band.
